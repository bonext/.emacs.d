# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.0.0 (2026-04-21)

### New features

* Published on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/tokyo-night); base package
  renamed to `tokyo-night` for MELPA namespace compliance.
* Face coverage expanded to mu4e, notmuch, evil, plus 12 additional
  packages.

### Bug fixes

* Give `show-paren-mismatch` a visible background (previously `tokyo-bg`
  was effectively no lift).
* Fix `hi-pink` using red background instead of pink.
* Align `font-lock-type-face` with DESIGN.md so types are distinguishable
  from builtins.

### Documentation

* Add section on automatic light/dark theme switching (auto-dark, circadian).
